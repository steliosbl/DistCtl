# DistCtl

DistCtl is a simple platform for managing work that has to be distributed accross many physical or virtual machines. The 'work' executed is defined by the user, the only requirement being that it is a constantly running process.

DistCtl offers advanced features such as load balancing across machines (or 'nodes') with different processing capacity, job redundancy, as well as online configuration and management of the platform.
